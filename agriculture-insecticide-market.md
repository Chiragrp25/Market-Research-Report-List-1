<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Insecticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Systemic Insecticides</li><li>Contact Insecticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agriculture insecticide market consists of two main types: systemic insecticides and contact insecticides. Systemic insecticides are absorbed by plants and circulate throughout their tissues, providing long-lasting protection against insects that feed on them. They are usually applied to the soil or injected into plants. In contrast, contact insecticides are applied directly to the surface of plants and kill insects when they come into contact with the treated area. They provide immediate protection but may require frequent reapplication. Both types play a crucial role in controlling insect pests in agricultural systems.</p></p>
