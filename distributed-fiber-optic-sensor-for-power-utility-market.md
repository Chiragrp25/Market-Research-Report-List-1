<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Fiber Optic Sensor for Power Utility Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multimode</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the power utility market, there are two types of distributed fiber optic sensor systems: single-mode and multimode. Single-mode systems use a single optical fiber to transmit light, allowing for long-distance communication with minimal signal loss. These systems are commonly used in applications that require high precision and accurate measurements. Multimode systems, on the other hand, use multiple optical fibers to transmit light signals, enabling higher data transmission rates over shorter distances. This makes them suitable for applications that require higher data capacity but can compromise on accuracy over longer distances.</p></p>
