<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PPG Polyurethane</li><li>PTMEG Polyurethane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane tires have two main types, PPG Polyurethane and PTMEG Polyurethane. PPG Polyurethane is made by combining a polyether polyol with an isocyanate, resulting in a durable and flexible tire material. These tires offer excellent resistance to abrasion and can withstand harsh environmental conditions, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, PTMEG Polyurethane is produced by reacting a polytetramethylene ether glycol with an isocyanate. These tires exhibit high strength and elasticity, making them ideal for applications that require good load-bearing capability and shock absorption.</p></p>
