<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DeNOx-SCR Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Honeycomb</li><li>Plate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DeNOx-SCR Catalysts market can be categorized into two types: honeycomb and plate. Honeycomb catalysts are characterized by their structure, which comprises numerous small channels or cells formed in a honeycomb-like shape. These catalysts offer high surface area, enabling efficient contact between the catalyst and exhaust gases. Plate catalysts, on the other hand, consist of flat or curved plates that are arranged in a stack. They provide large available surface for gas reactions. Both types of catalysts are commonly used in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from industrial processes.</p></p>
