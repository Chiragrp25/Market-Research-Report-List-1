<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Vehicle Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Gear Transmission</li><li>Multi Gear Transmission</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hybrid vehicle transmission refers to the mechanism that transfers power from the engine to the wheels. There are two main types: single gear transmission and multi-gear transmission. Single gear transmission, also known as direct drive, uses a single gear ratio to transfer power, simplifying the transmission system and increasing efficiency. On the other hand, multi-gear transmission offers multiple gear ratios to optimize power delivery at different speeds, resulting in better acceleration and fuel economy. Both types have their benefits and are used in different hybrid vehicle models based on their performance requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Hybrid Vehicle Transmission Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</li><li>Micro Hybrid Electric Vehicle</li><li>Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle</li><li>Full Hybrid Electric Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hybrid vehicle transmission market includes various applications such as Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), Micro Hybrid Electric Vehicles, Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and Full Hybrid Electric Vehicles. PHEVs are equipped with a battery that can be charged from an external power source, providing a longer all-electric range. Micro and Mild Hybrids utilize start-stop technology to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, with the latter having a slightly higher level of electrification. Full Hybrids, on the other hand, combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor for improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.</p></p>
