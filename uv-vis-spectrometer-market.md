<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV-Vis Spectrometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Beam</li><li>Double-Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The UV-Vis spectrometer market comprises two main types: single-beam and double-beam spectrometers. Single-beam spectrometers measure the intensity of light transmitted through a sample, making them simpler and more affordable. Double-beam spectrometers, on the other hand, compare the light intensity between a reference beam and a sample beam, offering higher accuracy and stability. While single-beam spectrometers are suitable for routine analysis, double-beam spectrometers are preferred for applications requiring precise measurements and low drift over time. Both types find applications in various industries, such as pharmaceuticals, environmental monitoring, and chemical analysis.</p></p>
