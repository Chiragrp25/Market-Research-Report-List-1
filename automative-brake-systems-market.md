<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automative Brake Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Hydraulic</li><li>Pneumatic</li><li>Electromagnetic</li><li>Combined</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive brake systems market comprises various types of braking systems, including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electromagnetic, and combined systems. Mechanical brake systems utilize cables or rods to transmit force from the brake pedal to the brake shoe. Hydraulic systems use fluid to transfer force from the brake pedal to the caliper, which applies pressure on the brake pads. Pneumatic brake systems work similarly to hydraulic systems but use compressed air instead of fluid. Electromagnetic brake systems use magnetic force to generate braking power. Combined systems incorporate multiple types of braking technologies for enhanced performance and safety.</p></p>
