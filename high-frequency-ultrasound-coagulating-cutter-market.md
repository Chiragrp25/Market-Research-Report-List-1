<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Ultrasound Coagulating Cutter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Frequency Ultrasound Coagulating Cutter is used in surgical procedures to cut and coagulate tissues. There are two main types of this device in the market: Monopolar and Bipolar. In Monopolar coagulation, an electric current passes through the patient's body to a grounding pad, allowing for deep tissue coagulation. Bipolar coagulation, on the other hand, uses two electrode tips to deliver the current directly to the targeted tissue, making it suitable for delicate procedures. These types provide surgeons with versatile options based on their specific surgical needs.</p></p>
