<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Needle-free Infusion Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure</li><li>Non Positive Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The needle-free infusion connectors market comprises two types: Positive Pressure and Non-Positive Pressure. Positive Pressure connectors help force fluid into the patient's vein using a mechanical force, such as a spring or gas. They provide a secure connection and prevent any leakage or blood reflux during infusion. On the other hand, Non-Positive Pressure connectors rely on gravity or the patient's natural blood pressure to move fluid into the vein. These connectors are often used in situations where high pressure is not required and can be more cost-effective.</p></p>
