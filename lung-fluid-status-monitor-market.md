<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung FLuid Status Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lung fluid status monitor market can be categorized into two types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive lung fluid status monitors require the insertion of a probe or catheter into the patient's lungs to directly measure fluid levels. These monitors provide accurate and real-time information but are more invasive and carry higher risks. On the other hand, non-invasive lung fluid status monitors utilize external sensors or imaging techniques to indirectly assess fluid levels. While non-invasive monitors are safer and more comfortable for patients, they may offer slightly less precise data compared to invasive methods.</p></p>
