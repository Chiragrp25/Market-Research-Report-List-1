<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Voltage Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Voltage Tester</li><li>Non-contact Voltage Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Voltage testers are essential tools used in electrical work to determine the presence or absence of voltage in electrical systems. There are two main types: contact voltage testers and non-contact voltage testers. Contact voltage testers require physical contact with the electric conductor to detect voltage levels accurately. On the other hand, non-contact voltage testers, also known as voltage detectors, can detect voltage without direct contact. They use capacitive or inductive sensors to trace the electromagnetic field surrounding the live conductor, providing a safe and convenient way to determine voltage presence.</p></p>
