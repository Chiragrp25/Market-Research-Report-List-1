<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive PM2.5 Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Channel</li><li>Dual Channel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive PM2.5 sensor market is categorized into two types: single-channel and dual-channel. A single-channel sensor measures the concentration of PM2.5 particles in the air using a single detection channel. It provides accurate data on the total PM2.5 particle concentration. On the other hand, a dual-channel sensor has an additional detection channel apart from the PM2.5 channel, allowing it to differentiate between different particle sizes. This provides more detailed information on the composition and distribution of particles in the air, helping in assessing air quality more comprehensively.</p></p>
