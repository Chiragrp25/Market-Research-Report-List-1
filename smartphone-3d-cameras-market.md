<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smartphone 3D Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Binocular Stereo Vision</li><li>Time of Flight</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Smartphone 3D Cameras market comprises different types, namely Binocular Stereo Vision and Time of Flight (ToF) cameras. Binocular Stereo Vision relies on two lenses to perceive depth and create a 3D image of the environment. It calculates the distance to objects by comparing the different images captured by each lens. On the other hand, ToF technology measures the time it takes for light to bounce back from objects to determine their distance. Both methods enable smartphones to capture immersive and realistic 3D content for various applications.</p></p>
