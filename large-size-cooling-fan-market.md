<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Size Cooling Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The large size cooling fan market consists of three main types of fans: axial fans, centrifugal fans, and others. Axial fans are designed to move air parallel to the fan's axis, creating a large volume of air flow with low pressure. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, use rotating impellers to redirect air at a right angle to the airflow direction, generating higher pressure and air velocity. The "others" category includes various fan types that do not fit into the axial or centrifugal fan classifications, such as mixed flow fans and cross flow fans.</p></p>
