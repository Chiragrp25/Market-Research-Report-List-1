<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Hydrogels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Crosslinking</li><li>Physical Crosslinking</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Self-healing hydrogels are a type of material that can autonomously repair themselves when damaged. Chemical crosslinking is a method where the hydrogel network is formed through the use of chemical bonds. In this process, molecules are combined to create a stable three-dimensional structure. On the other hand, physical crosslinking involves the use of physical interactions, such as reversible bonds or entanglements, to form the hydrogel network. This method allows for the formation of dynamic structures that can easily respond to external stimuli and heal themselves when damaged.</p></p>
