<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Termite Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-ground Termite Control System</li><li>Above-ground Termite Control System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Termite control systems can be categorized into two main types: in-ground and above-ground. In-ground systems involve the installation of bait stations or chemical barriers underground, creating a barrier between termites and the building. These systems are effective in preventing subterranean termites from reaching the structure. On the other hand, above-ground termite control systems primarily involve the use of baits or chemical treatments on the surfaces of the building, targeting termites that infest above-ground structures. Both types of systems aim to eliminate or control termite populations and protect buildings from damage.</p></p>
