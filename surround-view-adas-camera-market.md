<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surround View ADAS Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocular</li><li>Binocular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Surround View ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) camera market consists of two main types: Monocular and Binocular cameras. Monocular cameras use a single lens to capture images and provide a 360-degree view around the vehicle. They are cost-effective but may lack depth perception. On the other hand, Binocular cameras use two lenses to capture stereo images, enabling better depth perception and accurate object detection. Although more expensive, Binocular cameras offer enhanced safety features for autonomous driving and parking assistance. Both types play a crucial role in providing visual information to support drivers and improve overall road safety.</p></p>
