<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Output＞300 MW Condensing Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombustion</li><li>Non-recombustion</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The output > 300 MW condensing steam turbine market can be categorized into two types: recombustion and non-recombustion. Recombustion turbines involve the combustion of additional fuel or waste gases in order to increase steam production and subsequently the power output of the turbine. In contrast, non-recombustion turbines do not employ this additional combustion process and rely solely on steam generation through traditional means. Both types serve the purpose of generating electricity, but recombustion turbines have the potential to achieve higher power outputs due to their supplemental fuel combustion.</p></p>
