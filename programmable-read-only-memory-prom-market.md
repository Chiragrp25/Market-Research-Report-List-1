<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Read-only Memory (PROM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OTPROM</li><li>EPROM</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) is a type of memory chip that can be programmed only once. It is available in two market types: OTPROM and EPROM. OTPROM (One-Time Programmable ROM) allows the user to program the memory once, after which it becomes permanently fixed. EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) allows for reprogramming by erasing the memory using ultraviolet light. Both PROM types are non-volatile, retaining data even when power is turned off, making them suitable for applications requiring data storage that cannot be easily altered or erased.</p></p>
