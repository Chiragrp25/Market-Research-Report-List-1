<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intumescent Fire Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intumescent fire coatings are designed to provide protection against fire by expanding and forming an insulating layer when exposed to heat. There are two main types of intumescent fire coatings: water-based and solvent-based. </p><p>Water-based coatings are formulated with water as the base, making them eco-friendly and easy to apply. They dry quickly and offer good resistance to fire. On the other hand, solvent-based coatings use organic solvents as the base, providing fast drying and better adhesion to substrates, but they may release harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during application.</p></p>
