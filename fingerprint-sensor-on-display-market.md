<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fingerprint Sensor on Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical</li><li>Ultrasonic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fingerprint sensor on display market consists of two main types: optical and ultrasonic. Optical fingerprint sensors illuminate the user's fingerprint and capture its image through a high-resolution camera. This image is then processed using pattern recognition algorithms to authenticate the user. On the other hand, ultrasonic fingerprint sensors use soundwaves to map the unique 3D characteristics of a fingerprint. These soundwaves bounce off the finger and create a detailed fingerprint image, which is then used for authentication. Both types have their own advantages and variations, offering different levels of accuracy, speed, and security.</p></p>
