<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Tonometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Noncontact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desktop tonometer market comprises two major types: contact type and non-contact type tonometers. A contact type tonometer involves direct contact between the device and the patient's eye, typically using a small probe or sensor to measure intraocular pressure. On the other hand, non-contact type tonometers do not require physical contact with the eye and instead use a puff of air or other methods to measure intraocular pressure. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing conditions like glaucoma and are employed by healthcare professionals worldwide.</p></p>
