<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arc Welding Torche Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Welding Torche</li><li>Water-Cooled Welding Torche</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arc welding torches are categorized into two types: air-cooled and water-cooled. Air-cooled welding torches use the surrounding air to dissipate the heat generated during the welding process. They are typically lightweight, cost-effective, and easy to handle. In contrast, water-cooled welding torches rely on a flow of water to cool down the torch and prevent overheating. They are more efficient in long welding operations, as they can sustain high heat levels for extended periods. However, water-cooled torches tend to be bulkier, more expensive, and require additional equipment for water circulation.</p></p>
