<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Reactive Diluents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monofunctional Type</li><li>Bifunctional Type</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Epoxy Reactive Diluents market consists of three main types: Monofunctional, Bifunctional, and Other. Monofunctional diluents are epoxy resins that contain only one reactive group, allowing for limited cross-linking with other molecules. Bifunctional diluents have two reactive groups, enabling more extensive cross-linking and enhancing the epoxy's mechanical properties. The Other category includes diluents with specialty functionalities or those derived from renewable sources. These different types cater to specific applications and requirements, allowing manufacturers to select the most suitable diluent for their epoxy formulations.</p></p>
