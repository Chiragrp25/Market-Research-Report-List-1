<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Antistat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Antistatic Agent</li><li>Non-Metallic Antistatic Agents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fuel antistat market consists of two main types: metal antistatic agents and non-metallic antistatic agents. Metal antistatic agents are compounds that contain metallic elements such as copper or zinc, which have the ability to neutralize static electricity in fuel systems. Non-metallic antistatic agents, on the other hand, are compounds that do not contain any metallic elements. These agents work by forming a protective film on the fuel's surface, preventing the buildup of static charges. Both types of antistatic agents are used to ensure safe and efficient fuel storage and transportation.</p></p>
