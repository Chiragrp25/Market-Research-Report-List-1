<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapor Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less than 0.1 Perm</li><li>0.1 Perm-1.0 Perm</li><li>1.0 Perm-10 Perm</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The vapor retarder market is classified into three types based on their permeance levels. Permeance refers to the ability of a material to allow moisture to pass through. The first type, less than 0.1 Perm, indicates materials with extremely low permeability, effectively preventing moisture transfer. The second type, 0.1 Perm–1.0 Perm, includes materials with moderate permeability that allow controlled moisture movement. The third type, 1.0 Perm–10 Perm, comprises materials with higher permeability, enabling greater moisture transfer. These classifications help builders select appropriate vapor retarder materials based on their specific requirements for moisture protection.</p></p>
