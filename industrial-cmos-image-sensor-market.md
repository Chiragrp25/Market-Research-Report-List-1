<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FSI</li><li>BSI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial CMOS Image Sensor market consists of two types: Front-Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back-Side Illuminated (BSI). FSI sensors have a traditional structure with light-sensitive pixels placed on the front side. They are widely used due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of manufacturing but have limitations in low-light conditions. In contrast, BSI sensors have a flipped structure that places the pixel array on the backside, enabling better light gathering capabilities and improved sensitivity. These sensors are more suitable for applications that require high-quality imaging in challenging lighting environments.</p></p>
