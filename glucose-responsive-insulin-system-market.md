<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glucose Responsive Insulin System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rapid Acting</li><li>Short Acting</li><li>Intermediate Acting</li><li>Long Acting</li><li>Premixed Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Glucose Responsive Insulin System market consists of different types of insulin with varying durations of action. Rapid-acting insulin, like insulin lispro, acts quickly after injection and lasts for a short period. Short-acting insulin, such as regular insulin, is also fast-acting but lasts a bit longer. Intermediate-acting insulin, like NPH insulin, takes longer to start working but has a prolonged duration. Long-acting insulin, such as insulin glargine, provides a steady release over an extended period. Premixed insulin combines rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin in one injection for easier dosing.</p></p>
