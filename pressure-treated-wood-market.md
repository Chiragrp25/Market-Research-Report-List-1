<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure-treated Wood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardwoods</li><li>Softwoods</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pressure-treated wood is categorized into two market types: hardwoods and softwoods. Hardwoods are derived from broad-leaved trees such as oak, maple, and mahogany. They possess inherent strength, density, and durability, making them resilient to decay and insect damage. Softwoods, on the other hand, are derived from coniferous trees like pine, cedar, and spruce. These woods are known for their lightness, straight-grained structure, and ease of working. Both hardwoods and softwoods are treated with chemicals under pressure to enhance their resistance to rot, decay, and pests, making them suitable for a wide range of outdoor applications.</p></p>
