<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Antifriction Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spherical</li><li>Cylindrical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The railway antifriction bearing market consists of two types: spherical bearings and cylindrical bearings. Spherical bearings have a spherical inner ring raceway that allows for angular misalignment and axial displacement. This design is suitable for applications where there is a need for flexibility in movements. On the other hand, cylindrical bearings have a cylindrical inner ring raceway and are better suited for applications with high radial load capacity and moderate axial loads. Both types of bearings are used in the railway industry to reduce friction and enhance the efficiency of trains and other rail vehicles.</p></p>
