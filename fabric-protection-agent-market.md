<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fabric Protection Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fabric protection agent market is categorized into two types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based fabric protection agents are those that use water as a carrier for the active ingredients. They are more environmentally friendly and less toxic than solvent-based agents. On the other hand, solvent-based fabric protection agents use solvents as a carrier, which often contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While solvent-based agents may offer superior durability and resistance, they can pose health and environmental risks. Both types serve the purpose of protecting fabrics from stains, spills, and other forms of damage.</p></p>
