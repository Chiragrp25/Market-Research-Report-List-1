<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFMicrowave Mixer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Mixers</li><li>Passive Mixers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>RF/microwave mixers are electronic devices used to convert the frequency of an input signal to a different frequency. Active mixers are integrated circuits that require a power supply and amplification to function, offering high conversion gain and good linearity. Passive mixers, on the other hand, do not need external power and rely on non-linear characteristics of diodes or transistors. They are smaller in size and are simpler in design but may have lower conversion gain and limited dynamic range compared to active mixers.</p></p>
