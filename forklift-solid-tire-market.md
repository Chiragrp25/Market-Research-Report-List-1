<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forklift Solid Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cured-On Solid Tire</li><li>Pressed-On Solid Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The forklift solid tire market can be categorized into two types: Cured-On Solid Tire and Pressed-On Solid Tire. Cured-On Solid Tires are manufactured by curing the rubber onto the metal rim, providing a strong bond between the rubber and rim. This type offers better heat dissipation and provides a longer lifespan. Pressed-On Solid Tires, on the other hand, are installed by pressing the tire onto the rim using a hydraulic press. Although they are less durable compared to cured-on tires, they offer an easier installation process and cost-friendly solution.</p></p>
