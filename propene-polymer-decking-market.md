<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propene Polymer Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propene polymer decking market encompasses two main types: capped composite and uncapped composite. Capped composite decking consists of a polymer shell that provides protection against scratches, stains, and fading, making it highly durable and low-maintenance. This type of decking is ideal for areas with harsh weather conditions. On the other hand, uncapped composite decking lacks the protective polymer shell, making it more susceptible to wear and tear. However, it is still a cost-effective and stylish option for decking, especially for moderate weather regions.</p></p>
